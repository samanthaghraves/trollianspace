#  Contributing to Mastodon Glitch Edition  #

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the `glitch-soc` project!
Here are some guidelines, and ways you can help.

>   (This document is a bit of a work-in-progress, so please bear with us.

##  Planning  ##

Right now a lot of the planning for this project takes place in our development Discord, or through GitHub Issues and Projects.
We're working on ways to improve the planning structure and better solicit feedback, and if you feel like you can help in this respect, feel free to give us a holler.

##  Documentation  ##

The documentation for this repository is available at [`glitch-soc/docs`](https://github.com/glitch-soc/docs) (online at [glitch-soc.github.io/docs/](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/)).
Right now, we've mostly focused on the features that make this fork different from upstream in some manner.
Adding screenshots, improving descriptions, and so forth are all ways to help contribute to the project even if you don't know any code.

##  Frontend Development  ##

## Bug reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions can be submitted to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues). Please make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected in the past using the search function.

## Pull requests

Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests. We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the master branch will carry the title of the pull request.

The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged. Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.

**Pull requests that do not pass automated checks may not be reviewed**. In particular, you need to keep in mind:

- Unit and integration tests (rspec, jest)
- Code style rules (rubocop, eslint)
- Normalization of locale files (i18n-tasks)
